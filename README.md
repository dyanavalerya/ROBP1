# ROBP1
Robotics BSc 1st Semester Project meant for mobile robots

The goal of the project is to move a mobile robot between three different points, randomly inserted on the map (visualized
with the help of Rviz). The robot should be able to avoid collisions on the way and plan its path according to the available obstacles. 

The project uses ROS (Robot Operating System), which runs on Linux, to be able to manipulate mobile robots (in this case a 
Turtlebot 2). The program includes mapping and path planning algorithms and nodes that work with data from the 3D sensor.
